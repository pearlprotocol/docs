# Installation

To create a React application with @pearlx/react, you have the option to use one of three popular tools: Create React App (CRA), Vite, or Next.```js. To run @pearlx/react, it's important to have the latest LTS version of Node installed on your system.
`@pearlx/react` is a library that provides an authentication provider for React applications. The PearlProvider component is used to wrap the main application component and provide authentication functionality.


## Setup

Installation

To install @pearlx/react, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @pearlx/react

pnpm install @pearlx/react

yarn add @pearlx/react
```


## Usage

To use @pearlx/react, first import the PearlProvider component from the library:

```js
import { PearlProvider } from "@pearlx/react";


Next, wrap your main application component with the PearlProvider component, passing in the required config object:

javascript
<React.StrictMode>
  <PearlProvider
    config={{
        callbackUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
        clientId: "test123",
        encrypt: true,
        password: "apoorv1234",
        provider: "DISCORD",
        cookieName: "pearlx",
        kyc: "GOVERNMENT"
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </PearlProvider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

#### The config object must contain the following properties:

`clientId`: The client ID for your Pearlx authentication application.
`callbackUrl`: The callback URL to redirect to after authentication.
`provider`: The authentication provider to use (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.).
`cookieName`: The name of the cookie to use for authentication.

#### Configuring the Provider

The PearlProvider component takes a config object as a prop, which must include the properties mentioned above. Here's what each of them means:

`clientId`: Your Pearlx authentication client ID, which you can obtain from the Pearlx authentication dashboard.

`callbackUrl`: The URL that Pearlx should redirect the user to after authentication is complete. This URL must be listed as an authorized redirect URI in your Pearlx authentication dashboard.

`provider`: The authentication provider to use. This can be one of the following values from the providers enum:
providers.google
providers.discord
providers.github

`cookieName`: The name of the cookie that will be set upon successful authentication.

`password`: The hash of the password that will be used to encrypt the key.

`encrypt`: Whether to encrypt the key or not.

`kyc`: The KYC provider to use. This can be one of the following values from the kyc enum:
kyc.government
kyc.document



#### Using the Provider

Once you've configured the provider, you can use the provider in root of your project.

##### Example

```ts 
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { PearlProvider, providers } from "@pearlx/react";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PearlProvider
      config={{
        clientId: "63fc80e8da0cb8775e46fc73",
        callbackUrl: "http://localhost:5173",
        provider: providers.google,
        cookieName: "cookieName"
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </PearlProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
